<AMARELO>Aeroga<BRANCO> while it is storing up energy will stagger it,
opening it up to extra damage, especially from
<AMARELO>magic<BRANCO>.

[3341]
Tailbunker
!------------------------------!
    These large aerial Heartless
are hard to hit in mid-flight.
    Strike their wings and tail to
force them to land, then target
the head, which is susceptible to <AMARELO>Blizzard<BRANCO> magic.
!------------------------------!

!******************************!
[3543]
Avalanche
!------------------------------!
    These large aerial Heartless
use their potent <AMARELO>ice breath<BRANCO> to
attack their prey.
    Strike their wings and tail to
force them to land, then focus attacks on their
head, which is weak against <AMARELO>Fire<BRANCO> magic.
!------------------------------!

!******************************!
[3442]
Wavecrest
!------------------------------!
    These large aerial Heartless
use their potent <AMARELO>water breath<BRANCO> to
attack their prey.
    This strain cannot be forced
to land, so be sure to face them well-equipped to
do combat in midair.
!------------------------------!

!******************************!
[3645]
Phantomtail
!------------------------------!
    These large aerial Heartless
can't be harmed by blows to the
head, instead <AMARELO>warping<BRANCO> to a
remote location on impact.
    They won't warp, however, if you attack their
wings or tail, so focus attacks there. Go in
equipped for aerial combat.
!------------------------------!

!******************************!
[3744]
Windstorm
!------------------------------!
    These large aerial Heartless
use their potent <AMARELO>whirlwind
breath<BRANCO> to attack their prey.
    They are hard to hit in mid-
flight, so strike their wings and tail to force them
to land, then focus attacks on their head, which is
weak against <AMARELO>Thunder<BRANCO> magic.
!------------------------------!

!******************************!
[3846]
Dustflier
!------------------------------!
    Large and deadly, these
flying Heartless pack extreme
power and high HP levels.
    Their arsenal includes <AMARELO>Meteor
breath<BRANCO> and an <AMARELO>invincible charge<BRANCO>, and all of their
attacks can inflict negative status effects on
contact.
    This specimen is easily in the strongest class of
Heartless. Prepare accordingly.
!------------------------------!

!******************************!
[2C36]
Veil Lizard
!------------------------------!
    This camouflaged creature
attacks prey with a <AMARELO>tongue lash<BRANCO>
attack.
    <AMARELO>Block<BRANCO> it to dizzy the lizard,
then strike back. You can nullify its camouflage
with a solid hit.

TIP: <AMARELO>Light<BRANCO>-based attacks like its <AMARELO>glare<BRANCO> will <AMARELO>zap
your radar<BRANCO>, disabling the map.
!------------------------------!

!******************************!
[5A37]
Lurk Lizard
!------------------------------!
    Similar in form and behavior
to the Veil Lizard, these foes
attack prey with a <AMARELO>tongue lash<BRANCO>
attack.
    <AMARELO>Block<BRANCO> it to dizzy the lizard, then strike back.
<AMARELO>Blizzard<BRANCO> magic is also especially effective.
!------------------------------!

!******************************!
[3F55]
Guard Armor
!------------------------------!
    Large and heavily armored,
these Heartless will jump and
then crash into the ground,
creating a powerful <AMARELO>shockwave<BRANCO>.
    They drop their heads after landing, however;
strike then and the body will eventually fall to
pieces, with each piece acting autonomously. Start
with the limbs and take them all out.
!------------------------------!

!******************************!
[6356]
Powered Armor
!------------------------------!
    This improved version of the
Guard Armor still uses the same
basic tactics.
    The powerful <AMARELO>shockwave<BRANCO> it
produces causes it to drop its head. Strike then
and the body will eventually fall to pieces. Start
with the limbs and take them all out.
!------------------------------!

!******************************!
[2D4D]
Invisible
!------------------------------!
    Both fast and strong, these
Heartless pose a serious threat.
They attack with a fearsome
<AMARELO>shockwave<BRANCO>.
    Time your <AMARELO>combo finisher<BRANCO> so it connects right
after they catch their sword. This will cancel the
shockwave and leave them open.
!------------------------------!

!******************************!
[5F4E]
Orcus
!------------------------------!
    Though faster and more
powerful, these Heartless are
otherwise the same as the
Invisible. They attack with a
fearsome <AMARELO>shockwave<BRANCO>.
    Time your <AMARELO>combo finisher<BRANCO> so it connects right
after they catch their sword. This will cancel the
shockwave and leave them open.
!------------------------------!

!******************************!
[4234]
Dusk
!------------------------------!
    These lesser Nobodies handle
simple combat, recon and courier
operations.
    Though lacking in strength,
they have a robust repertoire of close-range
tactics, including <AMARELO>spinning charge<BRANCO> and <AMARELO>arm thrust<BRANCO>
attacks.
!------------------------------!

!******************************!
[4335]
Samurai
!------------------------------!
    An advanced Nobody well-
suited to combat in close
quarters.
    It pairs naturally high attack
power with a <AMARELO>dual blade attack<BRANCO> that brings targets
into submission.
    These Nobodies serve under Roxas.
!------------------------------!

!******************************!
[4652]
Darkside
!------------------------------!
    This giant Heartless will
devour all around it if left
unchecked.
    The <AMARELO>dark homing blasts<BRANCO> fired
from its chest can be turned back on it with a
<AMARELO>block<BRANCO>. Target its hands or, if possible, its head.

TIP: <AMARELO>Earth<BRANCO>-based attacks like its homing blasts
can <AMARELO>halve your current HP<BRANCO>.
!------------------------------!

!******************************!
[6253]
Dark Follower
!------------------------------!
    A stronger form of the
Darkside. Though more power-
ful, it follows the same basic
patterns as its predecessor.
    Send back the <AMARELO>dark homing blasts<BRANCO> fired from its
chest with a <AMARELO>block<BRANCO>, then attack either its hands or,
if possible, its head for maximum damage.
!------------------------------!

!******************************!
[415C]
Pete
!------------------------------!
    This shady character has
been sighted in multiple worlds
trying to amass an army of
Heartless.
    His <AMARELO>bowling-ball attack<BRANCO> causes <AMARELO>negative status
effects<BRANCO> at random.
    Though aggressive in combat, he'll flee the
moment his HP runs out.
!------------------------------!

!******************************!
[304F]
Lock
!------------------------------!
    One of the three imps living in
Halloween Town. Despite being
the trio's apparent leader, he
lacks real combat skill.
    Instead, he'll run about wildly while throwing
<AMARELO>pumpkin bombs<BRANCO> from afar. Hit them back with a
<AMARELO>block<BRANCO> to send him sprawling.
!------------------------------!

!******************************!
[3150]
Shock
!------------------------------!
    One of the three imps living
in Halloween Town. She poses
little threat in terms of
strength, but will attack with a

Lock's <AMARELO>pumpkin bombs<BRANCO> to send her sprawling.
!------------------------------!

!******************************!
[3251]
Barrel
!------------------------------!
    One of the three imps living in
Halloween Town. He poses little
threat in terms of strength.

with one of Lock's <AMARELO>pumpkin bombs<BRANCO> to send him
sprawling.

[6861]
Xigbar
!------------------------------!
    The Organization's No. <2161>, a
master of the arrowgun and
spatial manipulation. As a long-
range fighter, he'll try to keep
foes from closing in by <AMARELO>warping away<BRANCO> as he fires.
    The <AMARELO>full salvo<BRANCO> attack he uses in desperate
situations is truly devastating.
!------------------------------!

!******************************!
[7163]
? ? ?
!------------------------------!
    Little is known about this man,
save that he wears the coat of
our Organization.
    He has not been seen to
engage members in combat, instead merely jumping
and guarding while watching our movements.
    Do enough damage, and he'll warp away.
!------------------------------!

!******************************!
[7264]
? ? ?
!------------------------------!
    Reports on this figure have
existed for some time now.
    It was assumed this was the
man who defeated Xion, but the
truth of the matter remains unclear.
!------------------------------!

!******************************!
[4E58]
Antlion
!------------------------------!
    This massive Heartless swims
freely through the sand. Aim
for its face when it breaks the
surface.
    After sustaining damage, it will take to the sky,
but its <AMARELO>cyclone shield<BRANCO> protects it from direct
damage while airborne.
    Instead, hit the debris it throws back at it to
create an opening, then strike.
!------------------------------!

!******************************!
[475A]
Infernal Engine
!------------------------------!
    The <AMARELO>cannonballs<BRANCO> this heavy
tank Heartless fires can be
returned with a block to take
out the <AMARELO>archers<BRANCO> perched atop it.
    The battering ram that emerges from its mouth
before it <AMARELO>charges<BRANCO> is especially weak. Capitalize on
that vulnerability, but be sure to get out of there
before it begins its advance.
!------------------------------!

!******************************!
[696A]
Tentaclaw
!------------------------------!
    This tentacle-shaped
Heartless strikes with a savage
<AMARELO>bite<BRANCO>.

!------------------------------!

!******************************!
[4D57]
Leechgrave
!------------------------------!
    A massive plant-like
Heartless with a savage <AMARELO>claw<BRANCO>
attack. The <AMARELO>toxic pollen<BRANCO> it spews
from its head saps victims' HP
for as long as they breathe it.
    Destroy all of the Tentaclaws to dizzy the main
body, then move in.
    Note that defeating Tentaclaws or hitting them
with magic will speed up the pollen bursts.
!------------------------------!

!******************************!
[4054]
Crimson Prankster
!------------------------------!
    This newcomer to Wonderland
splits in two, attacking as a pair.
Unless both halves are
defeated at the same time, they
will continue the cycle of merging and splitting.
    Counter its <AMARELO>flamethrower<BRANCO> with <AMARELO>ice magic<BRANCO><2015>
Blizzaga if possible. <AMARELO>Aeroga<BRANCO> will halt its fiery <AMARELO>spin
attack<BRANCO>.

!******************************!
[4C59]
Ruler of the Sky
!------------------------------!
    You need to destroy all the
<AMARELO>tail segments<BRANCO> of this avian
Heartless to reveal its core.
    After each segment is
destroyed, the Ruler of the Sky will glow red and
<AMARELO>charge<BRANCO> its foes. Wait too close to the water's
surface and it will fire a salvo of <AMARELO>water shots<BRANCO>.
    Once the core is exposed, avoid the <AMARELO>spray of
coins<BRANCO> and counter with <AMARELO>Fire<BRANCO> magic.
!------------------------------!

!******************************!
[535D]
Sa<00ef>x
!------------------------------!
    The Organization's No. <2165><2161>.
Usually cool and calm, he turns
into a berserker when he grips

normal self, making him more susceptible to attack.
Finish him quickly.

Xion: Third Form
!------------------------------!
    Xion, transformed. Sora's
memories from each world have
multiplied her powers.
    Beware her <AMARELO>Ars Arcanum<BRANCO>
attack, a fierce flurry of blows from her four
arms. Most of her attacks cannot be blocked, so

raise a <AMARELO>barrier<BRANCO> to prevent it from healing her.
